# (Beautiful) Programmers' Stone

## Introduction

> Hi! This is a redesign of the http://programmersstone.com/ website. I've made the website more readable, cleaned the html up and also made the pages easier to navigate. Everybody is free to contribute, but if you want to write a pull request keep in mind that I'd like to keep the website free of javascript and lightweight.
