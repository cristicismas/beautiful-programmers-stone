    <h3>Adams, Scott</h3>
    <h3>The Dilbert Future</h3>
    Boxtree<br />
    ISBN 0-7522-1118-8<br />
    <p>
      Very funny and perceptive. A lot of nonsense is talked about Adams. Some
      say that he has failed to champion the cause of cubicle dwellers. As far
      as I know, he has never claimed to be the cubicle dwellers' champion -
      just a very funny cartoonist. Others say that he is a terrible, cynical
      person. This is because he documents workplace stupidity with staggering
      accuracy. All of the pomposity, dishonesty, bullying and ritualism is
      there. The end section of this book, about affirmations etc. should make
      your hair stand on end.

    <h3>Brookes, Frederick P.</h3>
    <h3>The Mythical Man-Month</h3>
    Addison Wesley<br />
    ISBN 0-201-00650-2<br />
    <p>
      Generally recognised as the most sensible guide to running practical,
      effective software projects, Brookes' every observation seems to have been
      thrown out by the ISO9001 ritual fixing zombies. This is why commercial
      software production is stagnant.

    <h3>DeMarco, Tom & Lister, Timothy</h3>
    <h3>Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</h3>
    Dorset House<br />
    ISBN 0-932633-05-6<br />
    <p>
      Common sense observations regarding making effective software projects.
      The best bits are the railing against open-plan offices. In Reciprocality,
      open-plan can be seen as desirable because ritual fixers love to regard
      one anothers' ritualised movements all day, and the endlessly ringing
      phones don't cause a problem, because no-one thinks anyway. Also look out
      for the comments on "jelled teams" and "professionalism" which is exposed
      as a euphemism for smirking pomposity.

    <h3>Degrace, Peter & Stahl, Leslie Hulet</h3>
    <h3>The Olduvai Imperative</h3>
    Prentice Hall<br />
    ISBN 0-13-220104-6<br />
    <p>
      The authors set out to write a book about CASE tools, and discovered the
      vast spaces waiting to be explored when we ask what we are really doing
      when we make software. I don't think the "Greeks vs. Romans" split they
      propose works too well, but they do introduce the idea that there are two
      distinct approaches.

    <h3>Feynman, Richard P.</h3>
    <h3>Feynman Lectures on Computation</h3>
    Addison Wesley<br />
    ISBN 0-20148991-0<br />
    <p>
      All good, but particularly the sections on Charles Bennett and the energy
      value of information. This book was stuck in legal wrangles for 10 years,
      but now we can get Feynman's words on this remarkable result, so essential
      in Reciprocality.

    <h3>Gamma, Erich et. al.</h3>
    <h3>Design Patterns: Elements of reusable Object-Oriented Software</h3>
    Addison Wesley<br />
    ISBN 0-201-63361-2<br />
    <p>
      <i>The</i> book on design patterns. Emphasises the compositional aspects
      of software design - the bit M0 victims can't do. Very handy on sites
      where the M0 reductionist misinterpretation of ISO9001 has got entirely
      out of hand. You just reference the pattern (by name) in the Architectural
      Design Document, and talk about details in the Detailed Design Document.
      This produces a useful document that doesn't <i>prevent</i> good
      composition by requiring the design to fit into an imbecilic, mandatory
      document structure created by people who can't understand what composition
      is, but are determined to stop it!

    <p>
      Fairy stories about how our heros manage to think around M0 and solve
      problems, instead of being driven off site with their stuff in binliners,
      which is what would really happen.

    <p>
      As far as anyone could go towards the Programmers' Stone while retaining
      M0 paradigm and language. The closest thing to the Programmers' Stone in
      print. The Journey of the title is of course, Hermetic.

    <h3>Hackers</h3>

    <p>
      How the "clearly very stupid" people changed the world. Starring Anukin
      Gates as the young Darth Vader. (Fact: In 1978 I bought a Microsoft
      product called EDAS for TRS-80 Model I. It was such rubbish I used it to
      write it's replacement and threw it away. The musicassette tape it came on
      was too small to hold anything useful. It's lineal descendent is called
      MASM.)

    <h3>Computing: A Human Activity</h3>
    ACM Press<br />
    ISBN 0-201-58069-1<br />
    <p>
      Wise words from the dawn of time. How could it possibly be anything
      <i>other</i> than a human activity, but people have forgotten this.

    <h3>Schwartz, Howard S.</h3>
    <h3>Narcissistic Process and Corporate Decay</h3>
    New York University Press<br />
    ISBN 0-8147-7938-7 <br />
    <p>
      Describes M0 in commercial settings in a Freudian model. The model is
      largely correct of course - M0 rather than infantile memories is where the
      motivational and delusional structure comes from.

    <h3>Senge, Peter M.</h3>
    <h3>The Fifth Discipline</h3>
    Random House<br />
    ISBN 0-7126-5687-1<br />
    <p>
      M0 free business thinking. Introduces "Sengian Patterns", which I reckon
      M0 victims will not be able to spot in real world situations.

    <h3>Spencer-Brown, George</h3>
    <h3>Laws of Form</h3>
    E. P Dutton<br />
    ISBN 0-525-47544-3<br />

      A cult classic amongst hackers nearly 30 years ago, also referenced in
      Robert Anton Wilson's "Universe Next Door" books.

    <h3>The Psychology of Computer Programming</h3>
    Van Nostrand Reinhold<br />

      This ancient text still hasn't been bettered. No-one dare look for some
      reason.

    <p>
      White doesn't seem to understand that alchemy is a transformation of the
      operator - mapping - but his journalism is excellent so you can draw your
      own conclusions from his data.

    <h3>Yourdon, Edward</h3>
    <h3>Decline and Fall of the American Programmer</h3>
    Prentice Hall<br />
    ISBN 0-13203670-3<br />
    <p>
      I've not yet seen the second edition. The offshore problem didn't happen,
      because programming isn't the kind of context-free proceduralism people
      think can be done well in open plan offices. Sets out the dreary
      predictability of the standard management stupidity rituals in M0 shops.
